  This example proves it is safer to work in onInitialize() hook than constructor because constructor gets executed too early

         currently we are going to get WicketRunTimeException with msg Page not found
         Reason is the panel constructor got executed before panel is added to the page
        move this to onInitialize and problem will go away
