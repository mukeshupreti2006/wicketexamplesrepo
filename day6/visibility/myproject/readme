 In this experiment we have seen component visibility we should handline in onconfigure hook , we shouldn't do in onbeforerender because if component is invisible its onbeforerender will not be executed

 if Parent is invisible, it children are also invisible (ie. their onebfore renderhook can't change visibility too)
  
That is why in wicket component Visiblity change we should do in onconfigure and not in onbeforerender
